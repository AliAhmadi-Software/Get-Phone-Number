## Get Phone Number With Python
This program can obtain the mobile numbers of people in Telegram groups based on the leaked Telegram database. 
The way it works is that the bot first logs in to an account and then receives the ID of the desired group and joins it. Then, based on the unique ID number of the group members, it matches it with the leaked database, extracts the numbers and finally delivers them as an Excel file.
